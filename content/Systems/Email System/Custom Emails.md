The "Emails" tab of the system allows you to create custom email templates that go out to specific audiences based on criteria selections. 
Those criteria are: 
- Audience Type: send email to abstract submitters or abstract reviewers, select "Submission Authors" to see the below options    
- Submission Type: If you want to filter by a specific submission type    
- Include Authors: allows to send to only main author or main author and all coauthors    
- Accepted As Type: Once reviews are complete and acceptances go out, can be selected to filter by acceptance type. Leave blank until acceptances go out   
- Audience Criteria: 
	- Submitted - if abstract is submitted
	- Confirmed - if the author has confirmed their intention to present at the meeting. (Select no until after confirmations go out)

Those filters should cover most if not all bulk email cases. Please contact IT if you believe a new filter or criteria should be added. For small-batch or single emails, there is a button titled "Send Individual Notification" that will allow that.

Once you save the email, you can type your email address into "Test Email Recipient(s)" (use a comma separated list with no spaces before or after the comma to do multiple addresses) and hit the "Send Test" button on the row where your template is. That will send 3 emails to the test recipients only, as well as let you know how many submissions fall under the selected criteria so you know before sending.

After the emails have been confirmed to be correct, and properly populating with the data from the merge fields, the "Send Notification" button can be pressed and the email will send to all records that match the selected criteria.
