Allows admins to make custom email templates and send them without the need for IT involvement.

The system only has 2 types of emails that are sent, the default submission email which is sent automatically after an abstract has been submitted in the system, and Custom emails, which are able to filter recipients to match whatever criteria is required.


### Default Submission Notification

This email is sent automatically upon final submission of an abstract to either the main author or all authors listed, depending on the selection. You can also edit the Email Subject and Template Body, which is the email body. For user-specific information such as a custom salutation with their name or their abstract title, there are merge fields listed below the body textbox that you can copy.


### [[Custom Emails]]

These allow admins to create a completely user-defined email. In-depth instructions at the link
