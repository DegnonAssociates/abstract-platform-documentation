The abstract system is a tool that allows client teams to create a customized abstract system with limited involvement from IT, and for users to then submit their research abstracts for consideration.  It also contains reporting and emailing features, as well as a review system, plus more to come! Here, you will find breakdowns of each of the pages and features/functionality of each one.
