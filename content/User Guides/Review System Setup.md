Similar to creating the initial submission system, a custom form is created for reviewers to fill out for submissions based on the submission's submission type. A form is required to be made for every submission type.
## Review Forms

To edit the forms go to Admin->Review Setup->Add/Edit Review fields. The process of adding the questions can be found [[Initial Setup#Adding Questions|here]] and is the same as adding questions to a submission form. Each submission type has an individualized review form that must be created for it. Please view the Scoring section below for an important note about numerical scores in reviews.
### Scoring

To add scores to the review forms, please use a radio button and for the options fields, include the possible scores as options, using the numerical value for the "Value" field (1,2,3,...) and then include whatever you want the reviewer to see for the "Label" field. This will allow you to write descriptive radio button labels, while also allowing the reports to use the numbers for score averaging and other important statistical calculations that will be useful when deciding on acceptances.
## Call For Reviewers

In this system, reviewers and submitters use the same login. In order to allow reviewers to sign up, a call for reviewer form must be created. This can be found under admin, submission setup, Add/Edit Call for Reviewers Questions. This form is created using the same method as submission, so check [[Initial Setup#Adding Questions|here]] for instructions. Once the form is created, go to admin, submission setup, General Configuration, and check the box next to "Add call for reviewers" at the bottom of the page. When a user views the main submission page after logging in, a box that says "Sign up to review" will appear. When they fill out the form and submit, they will be marked as a reviewer in the system. To disable the call for reviewers, just unselect the checkbox in General Configuration.
## Acceptance Types

Acceptance types are the names of the different ways a submission can be accepted. These are used for accepting abstracts, session assignments, and emails. These can be found under the admin tab by clicking the "Configure Acceptance Types" button.
