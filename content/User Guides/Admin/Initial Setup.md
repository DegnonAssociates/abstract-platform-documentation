### Before Starting

You will need to have the following information to create the abstract system
- Location and dates of meeting
- Whether the system will use Neon integration
- URL to meeting logo image
- URL to a PDF of any submission guidelines
- All submission types
- Questions and validation for each submission type
- Open/close dates of all submission types
- Wording for an email that is sent to all users who submit an abstract
- Any submission fees for submissions
### Steps to Set Up a New Instance
- As early as possible, notify IT that a new abstract submission system instance needs to be created
- IT will set up a new website for the system and incorporate any Neon integration
- Once the system is set up, IT will notify you to log in to the new system, which creates an account for the user
	- IT will grant the "Admin" role to the new user, allowing access to the setup features
	- Users will need to log out and log back in for role changes to take effect
- When logging in with admin privileges, the top bar of the site will have new options, click on "Admin" to navigate to the admin portal.
- Go to "General Configuration" and fill out any information not added by IT
	- This includes things like meeting location/dates, guideline url, etc.
	- These should all be available ahead of time from the "Before Starting" section
- Return to the admin main page, and navigate to "Add/Edit Submission Types"
	- Each submission type will appear as an option to be selected from the dropdown of available submission types to submit as when creating a new abstract
	- Information for each submission type will be things such as name of submission type, open/close date, max submissions of that type per author, max co-authors, whether there is a character or word count limit, and information for the review process later on
	- Add a new submission type for each path, submission types like symposia with child abstracts will be generated by clicking the "has sub-abstracts" option in the submission type editor
# Adding Questions 
- Once all submission types have been added, go to "Add/Edit Submission Fields" to add specific questions for each submission type
	- Select the submission type you wish to add a question to from the dropdown and click "Add New Field" to add a new question to the form
	- "Type" is a dropdown indicating what type of question it will be (radio button, textbox, dropdown...)
	- Heading and subheading are labels for the questions
	- If the "Required" checkbox is checked, the question will require the user to respond before allowing them to submit their abstract
	- If the submission field is a "Paragraph Text" type, "Included in Character/Word Count" can be used to add the word/character count of the textbox to the total character/word count of the submission. It will check the total against the limit set in the Submission Types editor.
		- Other validation, such as conditional rendering of questions and word count limits separate from a grand total of all textboxes will need to be done as a custom solution by IT for that specific instance, so just indicate that as soon as possible
	- "Included in Journal Output" if checked, will include the response to this field in the final Meeting presentation journal print copy. Most questions will likely have this checked, but refrain from including any sensitive information in the journal
	- The value in the "Validation Message" textbox will display to the user if the field is required but they have not responded to the question before submitting.
	- "Print Label" is the column name that will show up for this question in reports
	- Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, and Dropdowns
		- These question types allow a user to add "Options" to the question, indication a selectable value in the field. 
			- For checkboxes, each option would generate an individual checkbox in the group
			- Options have Values and Labels, which are used to display verbose information to users, while allowing the value stored in our data to be more readable on the reporting side in a table view.
				- The value can be understood as what the admins will see in reporting, and the label is what will be shown to users and anyone who views the abstracts from a user standpoint
				- One final thing to note, for review specifically, if you wish to do a numeric score in a radio button and want to be able to do aggregate functions such as averaging scores, you would set the value to just be the score number (1, 2, 3...) and the label will be whatever information you want to convey to the user and display to help them pick. If there are non-numeric values in the options for a score field, the averaging function will not work. Label does not care, so include instructions or descriptors there
	- Once questions have been entered for a submission type, they can be reordered by dragging and dropping the individual questions on the "Add/Edit Submission Fields" page
		- Repeat process until all questions are in for each submission type, and let IT know if any custom validation needs to be added by IT before opening the submission system.
- If the system asks CME questions, they can be created the same way as the submission fields. It is located at the "Add/Edit CME Questions"


- If a user has logged in and needs to have access to admin roles or other cases in which an admin will need to manually change roles, the admin page has a "User Administration" portal. There, you can search for the user that needs the updated roles, click "Edit" on the row for their user, and select the roles you wish to grant them from the available options.
- The final step that must be completed before starting, is to navigate to the "Emails" page from the top bar of the site, and click the "Edit Default Submission Notification Template" button
	- This email will be automatically sent upon final submission of an abstract of any type
	- To make it more modular, below the "Template Body" textbox, there is a list of merge fields to copy into the email body that will replace that merge field with the information for that submission
	- Once the default submission template is complete, the system should be able to open without issue

Please ensure that a submission for each submission type is submitted as a test, and ensure that all content is correct and validation is working properly, and the system will be ready to open at the date specified
