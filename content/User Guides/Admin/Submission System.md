Steps for successfully completing an abstract submission

1. Log in to the system. If using Neon, either use your existing Neon account or create a new account by clicking the "Create Account" button and following the steps to make a new account. For non-Neon clients, an account must be made when accessing the abstract system for the first time.
2. Once logged in, you are taken to the homepage of the app. Here you can see all of your current abstract submissions as well as create new submissions. The "Submission Deadlines" box on the page will display any submission types that can currently be created or edited. All abstracts of that type must be submitted by the deadline
3. Create a new submission, include the title of the abstract, and select a submission type from the dropdown list of active submission types. Clicking continue will create a new abstract of that type in the system.
4. Using the "Add New Author" button, include all authors that contributed to the submission. If they have Neon accounts as well, and the system uses the Neon login integration, you can search for authors' Neon accounts using the search bar which will auto-populate any author information that they have included on their Neon account.
	 - Authors can be dragged and dropped to change the order in which they appear
5. Click "Add/Edit Submission Information" to be taken to the abstract submission form. Fill out the information from your abstract into the form, and click "Save" to store the information in the system. A preview of your submission will appear beside the form displaying your current submission information. Saving does not submit the abstract, so feel free to save and come back later.
	 - If a field is required, putting in any text or selecting any options will allow you to save if you do not yet have that information ready to put in, just be sure to come back later and put in the final data
6. If all information is put in correctly, when you return to the submission overview, you should see a section called "Final Submission." Clicking the button will take you to a page where you can do a final submission of your abstract. Clicking "Complete Final Submission" will prevent you from editing in the future so ensure all information is accurate before clicking that button
7. An email will be sent to the email address associated with the submitter's account confirming submission
8. Submitted abstracts can be viewed but not edited
9. If you wish to delete a submission, click the delete button on the main page
